Little_THREE_PHASE_BLDC_CONTROL
===============================

Special control,haha!!


Got the Three Phase BLDC motor from taobao.com. I really got lot of fun from playing this big motor.

Man, that is really the first time i was playing with motor. The motor is for electric scooter, so you know

the power is large(25V 6A (Rating))

Initially, I really cannot program on it since i cannot communicate to the motor controller. The motor controller has to

be fixed by a front fork from a bycicle, which is not expensive in China (estimating 10 dollars)o(∩_∩)o 哈哈.

The seller told me that connecting two red wires can make the Three Phase BLDC motor rotate clockwise and connect two black wires from 

the motor controller can make the motor rotate counterclockwise.

So...I was doing lot of wiring...a circuit controlling clockwise and counterclockise by using BJTs(3906) and relays. Then

I can do programming by switching relays. 

I haven't used the motors in real cart or shopping cart, but may in the future. 

BTWIt is helly heavy when everytime I bring those two.
